  document.write("Here are the reasons why Michael Jordan is Better than LeBron James ");
  document.write("1. The 1990's was a more physical era, back then, flagrant fouls were if a player punches another player, also in the 2020's today is about long range shooting and not bumping arms and knees while being elbowed down after trying to drive to the rim");
 document.write(" 2. Even though LeBron fans keep saying longevity, Jordan literally scored 32k in 15 years when LeBron only got 30k, also Jordan took breaks because how boring the sport was, and the fact he could still score 20+ before father time defeated him is saying how much of a GOAT he was in the most recent era he played in. ");
document.write("3. Never yapping or flopping, he never said he needed help, he never traded his teammates to get a better one, instead he let the front office do whatever they want, also some of you who are reading this might send me clips of Jordan flopping, do note that these were because of the force he was given, not because he wanted to get a foul unlike your king. ");
ocument.write("4. Lastly, te media wants us to think LeBron is better, democracy votes that LeBron is better, unless you're bleacher report, they are both smart and dumb at the same time, putting Wilt higher than Curry even though he played against plumbers and towers over everybody in his era.
